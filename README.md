The environment we pick is Godot, and the language we are going to learn is C#. I am going to learn that through Codecademy.

Due to there are no totorial for C# using Godot, so we changed our idea and decided to learn GDscript instead. We used the "GDScript from 0" to learn that. 
I learned how to draw some basic shapes: 
  move forward()
  rotate()
also learned how to create a function by
  func name (parameter):

I keept learning on GDscript. I learned how to create and define a variable and how to edit it by + - * /
  var name = 10
  name*=10
  name-=5
  var word = 'hello'
var in GDScript can be in many format include number and words. 
I learned the special varible 'delta' which can help to overcome the frame difference in different computers. Also we can use delta to create a loop: 
  func process(delta):
Also I learned how to use a if statement and '>' '<' '==' '!='
  if x>y
    y++
